# Random Bascket Ball Leauge.
This is the [last task](https://github.com/SappirBo/CPP_EX6/tree/main/Info) in CPP course in Ariel University.</br>
The Idea is to create a basket ball leauge, create a schedule for it and run seasons. </br>
The scores will be set randomly (but the Team Rate and host/guest stats will be a factor on the winner calculation).</br></br>

On each Point of the season, you will be able to Stop to get some Analytical information about the leauge such as:
- Win / Lose stats.
- Rankings.
- Ave Score per game.
- Success Rate.
</br>   
and a lot more.
